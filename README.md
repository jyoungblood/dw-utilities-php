# DW Utilities (PHP)

### A collection of utility functions to facilitate an efficient workflow with the [Darkwave](https://github.com/jyoungblood/darkwave) web application toolkit.



# Installation
These functions are included with Darkwave, but they can be installed and used as standalone functions in any project.

Install the package with Composer:
```
composer require jyoungblood/dw-utilities
```

Then add it to your application:
```
use Darkwave\dw;
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```


# Available Methods

```php
dw::client_ip();
```


## dw::authenticate()
Parses the JWT 'token' cookie and sets global authentication variables to be used by the rest of the application.
```php
dw::authenticate();
```


## dw::generate_jwt($user)

```php

```


## dw::convert_image($args)

```php
dw::convert_image([
  'source' => $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/uploads/source-filename.jpg',
  'target' => $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] .  '/uploads/converted-filename.jpg',
  'resize' => [300, 300],
  // 'threshold' => 800
  'crop' => 'center',
  'quality' => 80
]);
